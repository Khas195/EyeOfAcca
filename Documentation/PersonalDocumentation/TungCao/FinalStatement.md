# Final Statement

---

I wished we have more time in developing the game. I felt like at the beginning we had a good rythm of working on the game. It was never boring or stressful while working on the game. At the end, however, for the purpose finishing the semester, We had to rush out the opening and ending sequence for the game of which we did not planned for at the beginning. 

I feel like we need more time to add more game mechanics and further polishing of the game before deciding to create a final product for the semester. I think what we have right now is a demo and if we're able to work on it for 6 more months then we might create something that can be commercialize. 

I had great teammates this semester. Though due to the corona situation, Sam was MIA for a week due to a cyclone going through his place. He was a project lead and manager so it was kind of rolf. Chris' arts are great as usually but I can see the last push to finish the game for this semester reduce the quality of his art just a bit. Ousama's level designs are somewhat problematic and not fit with the vision of the team but the lastest version was great overal. 

Overal, it was an ok semester due to the corona virus and we had to communicate in a detached and different ways.
