### __**Ideas Brainstorming(April 16th, 2020 - April 19th, 2020)**__

#### First Thoughts.

In the 2nd prototype, Sam asked me to do the prototype with him and Chris. I found the team's composition to be remarkable. Each of us respect and trust each other in the other skills to a very high respect. With Chris's art skill and Sam's design ability in combining with my programming, I think the team is perfectly suited to any project ... well, any small to medium scale 2D project......

 We all have soft skill in the others' area. For example, Chris and Sam can code. Me and Sam can draw pixel arts, though not as good as Chris. All three of us can do design....  

#### Thoughts on Team Meetings.
Unsuprisingly, we have good dynamic between the three of us since we have been hanging out with each other from the 2nd semester. Our meeting was fun and it feels less like a meeting and more like a group of friend just chatting about the game that they're about to make. 

#### Team's Agreement.

 In the meeting, we agreed that, due to us wanting to somewhat do other design part, it is ideal to have our main job of Programming, Art and Design but we can and probably will help others to do their stuffs if neccessary. If in that week I don't have any programming task left then I probably going help Chris draws some pixel arts. Me and Chris probably going to want to do some design works as well such as Level Design and Narrative Design. So in conclusion, our main job stays and we can work side jobs depend on the week.
