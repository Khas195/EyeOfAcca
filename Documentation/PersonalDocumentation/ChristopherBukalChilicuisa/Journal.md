## Brainstorming sessions, 14th April - 19th April

We used the first week to brainstorm ideas for mechanics we could implement into toys, then on Sunday we would decide on the best one to develop into a second prototype. We had a lot of genuinely
interesting concepts, some of which could definitely be saved for later use and development.

Ultimately it was decided that we would go with Sam's prototype idea of the teleporting boomerang mechanic. This idea seemed to have elements that most appealed to all three of us; a strategic element and
spacial dynamism.

## Fleshing out the mechanic, 20th April

Today, while discussing the details, we realised that this was far from a trivial mechanic. There were many pitfalls that could potentially suffocate the mechanic and prevent if from being utilized most
effectively. Should the boomerang be allowed to bounce around indefinitely? Should the player be allowed to teleport indefinitely? How would restrictions be communicated to the player? We spent over 3
hours pondering questions such as these in today's meeting. The solutions we came to seemed to us the best ways to handle these conditions, however only trying them out first-hand will yield definitive
results.

## Sprints 1 & 2, 10th May

We've made a lot of progress in the past two weeks, and I believe we'll have something really impressive by the end of the second sprint on Tuesday. The game has many interesting synergistic mechanics, 
but be once discussed an interaction which included solely the character and the axe such that the axe itself would feel justified, because if a level contained only the room, the player would have
nothing to do, other that throw the axe and recall it. One of the interactions we came up with was that the player could
hang on to the axe once it was stuck to a wall, and use that to travere levels. I liked the idea, however it would take much too long to implement so we decided to drop it.
