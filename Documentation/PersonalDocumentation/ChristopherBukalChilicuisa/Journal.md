## Brainstorming sessions, 14th April - 19th April

We used the first week to brainstorm ideas for mechanics we could implement into toys, then on Sunday we would decide on the best one to develop into a second prototype. We had a lot of genuinely
interesting concepts, some of which could definitely be saved for later use and development.

Ultimately it was decided that we would go with Sam's prototype idea of the teleporting boomerang mechanic. This idea seemed to have elements that most appealed to all three of us; a strategic element and
spacial dynamism.

## Fleshing out the mechanic, 20th April

Today, while discussing the details, we realised that this was far from a trivial mechanic. There were many pitfalls that could potentially suffocate the mechanic and prevent if from being utilized most
effectively. Should the boomerang be allowed to bounce around indefinitely? Should the player be allowed to teleport indefinitely? How would restrictions be communicated to the player? We spent over 3
hours pondering questions such as these in today's meeting. The solutions we came to seemed to us the best ways to handle these conditions, however only trying them out first-hand will yield definitive
results.
