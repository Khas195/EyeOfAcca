I wanted to make an exciting game. A game requiring fast action on the part of the player. 3D games simply take too much time to produce to seriously consider doing one for this semester. 
So a 2D game was quite obvious. However my tastes are not shared among my peers, and I must balance my wishes against theirs when designing this project.
