# Final Statement

---

This was a workload-heavy semester. Perhaps due to the wide scope of our project, or perhaps the assignments truly were dealt out with disproportionate zeal. Ultimately dedicating so much time and effort
into one project meant that my performance in other classes would consequently suffer, but I do not regret this decision, as I believe the final product is something we all involved may be proud of.
