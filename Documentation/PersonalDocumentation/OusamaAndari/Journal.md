_**This is a journal on my thoughts and feelings in this project.**_

## Before Joining Samartha Team , 5/5/2020 Last prototype HiddenAdventure.

It was so confusing for me to choose a team after leaving Hari team.
So I decided to Go with Christopher prototype and develop on it. unfortunatley the mechanic was limiting me somehow.
I decided to go with another project that I made from scratch and developed in a week Which I called Hidden Adventure. 
This prototype I worked on very hard and i was thtinking to keep working on it by myself until the end of the semster.
After Thinking a bit about working alone I had this feeling that it will be a lot of work (Programming/art/desgining/testing).

## After Joining Samartha Team , 8/5/2020 Acas Eye(Sprint 2-4).
*I joined the team of Samartha later on and Started the work from scratch with them.
I am currently using all thier systems and mechanics and trying to squeeze them as much as possible to make new puzzles ideas etc.
So far I have made 9 diffrent scenes in unity with diffrent puzzle instances, ideas even new mechanics but we are all still discussing what works and what doesn't.
I also made a lot of instances and 1 new mechanic using the railblock. I used the railblock the other way around. the rail block are supposed to move either horizontally or vertically in two opposite directions
and stay in the last position the player moved it to. but what i did was that I made the railblock that it can be pulled from one way hor.or ver. and that it goes back to it is original position, and I called this the broken rail block.
I showed this mechanic to the team and we all agreed on keeping it. Christopher had to make new art for this one, so we can make it clear that this one is the original and this is the broken.
The implementing of this new mechanic was at the ending of our last sprint.

## Community manager 29/5/2020 (Sprint 5) .
*I have created this day, 4 diffrent social accounts for our game.
Facebook,Twitter,Discord,reddit and we already have itch.io. 
I already created enough instances and ideas and now we are focusing more on other stuff such as Narrative and more testing in the game for movement.
I will start doing the final levels once we all agree on a specific system or outline and we are completly sure about.
I asked some people that day to playtest our game and give us feedback using the social media accounts I made. And I have got some feedbacks but was not so useful.

## The day I had my panic attack and everything went bad 1/6/2020 (middle Sprint 6).
*I was in berlin and started to have difficulties in breathing so I called a doctor and then I went to a hospital in munich. unfortunatly cause of the corona situation my turn was postponed and I had to stay in the hospital for another 2 days. .
They gave me a room to stay in it.
I had to wait and after few days I have seen the doctor and he gave me a medicine and I started to get better. 
I started to get a little better the day of 5/6/2020 and joined our group meeting again and updated some posts.
hopefully by the end of the month I will be good again.

## Milstone Presentation
I Had my part prepared and everything was alright but then shit happens and I had to miss this presentation.
I wish I was there because I wanted to talk about how effective was I in the team and how much ideas and instances I have showed and came up with.
But I also felt like this milstone presentation was diffrent than the one last year. cause normall we are supposed to stand infront of everyone and explain and show our game much easier than
just doing everything online which is ok but was not the best idea.

## Special Assignment (Life of Choala)(1/6/2020 - 8/6/2020).
This was the same day I had my problem and went to the Hospital, Unfotunatly I Could not do any type of work to help my team.
I was going to make a simple scene at monday morning but on monday I got my turn and the doctor had to check on me.
I spent almost 10 days out of berlin to get checked by the doctor.

## Focused more on recovering and catching up with all classes and assignments from other classes(15/6/2020).
at this point I was very lost and tired and not sure what to do. I had to recover so I took a break for few days, then started catching up with all missed infos from different classes.
After that I focused on growing the social media accounts for our game and catching up with all new updates in our game. As well as I asked some random people  from facebook and whatsapp to test our game
and they gave me thier feedback. I posted all the feedback on miro so my team can see it and discucss about it.

## Presentation day (DesignChallenge-16/6-2020)
I Was feeling kind of weird because no one else chooose the DesignChallenge, but I like challenges and I like talking about them, I did not know at the beginning what challenge I will face,
but I was very sure that I will have some design issues or problems because the teleport gem mechanic was an overpowered mechanic from the first prototype I have seen. 
I think I really made a perfect comparison between our Teleport Gem mechanic and Celsete Dash Gem that day.

## Designing the full game Level Outline on Miro Board(23/6/2020)(Sprint 7).
I finished and designed the full game level outline, and I showed it to my team and we all agreed on it. I started to get better as well healthwise.
I started creating the first levels and so far 10% done from the whole outline, It will take a lot of time because when I design I have to test a lot and check if every single tile of the 
level positioned or placed in the right place. 
(26/6/2020) I have finished 50% of the level outline and will finish the rest soon.

## Re Designing the full game Level Outline with Sam on Miro Board(29/6/2020)(Sprint 8).
I had to redesign the outline again with sam after his connection was good again. So we both made a new outline that we all agreed on and I started making the levels the next day directly.
unfortunaltley I had to remove the 5 old levels from my outline that I already spend over 4 days to finish them.
making the new outline was the worst pain in the ass, It had only 4 days to finish it by myself and I had to work daily from 8pm until 5am just making the game levels and testing them.
That was a lot of work but we had not time. I am happy anyways that I managed to finish everything in time although I got sick again cause of the lack of sleep.
