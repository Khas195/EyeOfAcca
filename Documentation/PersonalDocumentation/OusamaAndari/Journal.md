_**This is a journal on my thoughts and feelings in this project.**_

---
## Before Joining Samartha Team , 5/5/2020 Last prototype HiddenAdventure.

It was so confusing for me to choose a team after leaving Hari team.
So I decided to Go with Christopher prototype and develop on it. unfortunatley the mechanic was limiting me somehow.
I decided to go with another project that I made from scratch and developed in a week Which I called Hidden Adventure. 
This prototype I worked on very hard and i was thtinking to keep working on it by myself until the end of the semster.
After Thinking a bit about working alone I had this feeling that it will be a lot of work (Programming/art/desgining/testing).


## After Joining Samartha Team , 8/5/2020 Acas Eye.
*I joined the team of Samartha later on and Started the work from scratch with them.
I am currently using all thier systems and mechanics and trying to squeeze them as much as possible to make new puzzles ideas etc.
So far I have made 9 diffrent scenes in unity with diffrent puzzle instances, ideas even new mechanics but we are all still discussing what works and what doesn't.

## Community manager 29/5/2020 .
*I have created this day, 4 diffrent social accounts for our game.
Facebook,Twitter,Discord,reddit and we already have itch.io. 
We already had enough instances and ideas and now we are focusing more on other stuff such as Narrative and more testing.
we will start doing levels after the special assignment and I will start again with coming up with new idea and puzzle instances.

## The day I had my panic attack and everything went bad 1/6/2020 .
*I was in berlin and started to have difficulties in breathing so I called a doctor and then I went to a hospital in munich. unfortunatly cause of the corona situation my turn was postponed and I had to stay in the hospital for another 2 days. .
I had to wait and after few days I have seen the doctor and he gave me a medicine and I started to get better. 
Unfortunatly I missed my part in the milestone presentation.
I started to get a littlr bettter the day of 5/6/2020 and joined our group meeting again and updated some posts.
hopefully by the end of the month I will be good again.

## Special Assignment (Life of Choala)(1/6/2020 - 8/6/2020).
This was the same day I had my problem and went to the Hospital, Unfotunatly I Could not do any type of work to help my team.
I was going to make a simple scene at monday morning but on monday I got my turn and the doctor had to check on me.

## Focused more on recovering and catching up with all classes and assignments(15/6/2020).
I had to recover so I took a break for few days, then started catching up with all missed infos from different classes.
After having few days break I focused on growing the social media accounts for our game and catching up with all new updates in our game.

## Presentation day (DesignChallenge-16/6-2020)
I Was feeling kind of weird because no one else chooose the DesignChallenge, but I like challenges and I like talking about them, I did not know at the beginning what challenge I will face,
but I was very sure that I will have some design issues or problems. 

## Designing the full game Level Outline on Miro Board(23/6/2020).
I finished and designed the full game level outline, and I showed it to my team and we all agreed on it. I started to get better as well healthwise.
I started creating the first levels and so far 10% done from the whole outline, It will take a lot of time because when I design I have to test a lot and check if every single tile of the 
level positioned or placed in the right place.
I think I really made a perfect comparison between our Teleport Gem mechanic and Celsete Dash Gem that day.
