_**This is a journal on my thoughts and feelings in this project.**_

## Before Joining Samartha Team , 5/5/2020 Last prototype HiddenAdventure.

It was so confusing for me to choose a team after leaving Hari team.
So I decided to Go with Christopher prototype and develop on it. unfortunatley the mechanic was limiting me somehow.
I decided to go with another project that I made from scratch and developed in a week Which I called Hidden Adventure. 
This prototype I worked on very hard and i was thtinking to keep working on it by myself until the end of the semster.
After Thinking a bit about working alone I had this feeling that it will be a lot of work (Programming/art/desgining/testing).


## After Joining Samartha Team , 8/5/2020 Acas Eye.
*I joined the team of Samartha later on and Started the work from scratch with them.
I am currently using all thier systems and mechanics and trying to squeeze them as much as possible to make new puzzles ideas etc.
So far I have made 9 diffrent scenes in unity with diffrent puzzle instances, ideas even new mechanics but we are all still discussing what works and what doesn't.

## Community manager 29/5/2020 .
*I have created this day 4 diffrent social accounts for our game.
Facebook,Twitter,Discord,reddit and we already have itch.io. 
We already had enough instances and ideas and now we are focusing more on other stuff.
we will start doing levels after the special assignment and I will start again with coming up with new idea and puzzle instances.

## The day I had my panic attack and everything went bad 1/6/2020 .
*I was in berlin and started to have difficulties in breathing so I called a doctor and then I went to a hospital in munich. unfortunatly cause of the corona situation my turn was postponed and I had to stay in the hospital for another 2 days. .
I had to wait and after few days I have seen the doctor and he gave me a medicine and I started to get better. unfortunatly I missed my part in the milestone presentation.
I started to get bettter the day of 5/6/2020 and joined our group meeting again and updated some posts.
hopefully by the end of the month I will be good again.
