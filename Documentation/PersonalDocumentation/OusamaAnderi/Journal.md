_**This is a journal on my thoughts and feelings in this project.**_

## Before Joining Samartha Team , 5/5/2020 Last prototype HiddenAdventure.

It was so confusing for me to choose a team after leaving Hari team.
So I decided to Go with Christopher prototype and develop on it. unfortunatley the mechanic was limiting me somehow.
I decided to go with another project that I made from scratch and developed in a week Which I called Hidden Adventure. 
This prototype I worked on very hard and i was thtinking to keep working on it by myself until the end of the semster.
After Thinking a bit about working alone I had this feeling that it will be a lot of work (Programming/art/desgining/testing).


## After Joining Samartha Team , 8/5/2020 Acas Eye.
*I joined the team of Samartha later on and Started the work from scratch with them.
I am currently using all thier systems and mechanics and trying to squeeze them as much as possible to make new puzzles ideas etc.
