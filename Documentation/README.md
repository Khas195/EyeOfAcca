##### Version 0.0.2:


Boomeraxe:

    - Bounce Limit set to 2. ->I found that 2 bounces are better than once bounce because with 1 bounce it doesn't intuitively imply that the axe can bounce.
    - If the axe bounces 2 times then on the next contact with any surface it will teleport back.
    - If the axe exits the camera view then after 0.5s it will teleports back.
    - If axe hit any surface it will not return and continue going.
Character:

    - After teleport to the Axe, he will not be affected by gravity for 0.2s. ->I found 0.5s is too long for freezing in the air after some tries.
    - Replace normal 2d movement with 2D Platform movement.
Control:

    - Left Click to teleports axe back to player if the axe is not being held.
    - Left click to throw the axe if the axe is being held.
    - Right click to teleport to the axe.

    - Add level 3 for bounce testing.
    - New Level can be add by Duplicate the existing level -> alter it as u want, then add it to the build settings.

##### Version 0.0.3:


Boomeraxe:

    - The fly distance of boomeraxe will reset on bounce with a new anchor which is the contact point of the surface it touched.
    - On exceeding the fly distance after any bounce it will teleport back to the holder.
    - Remove throw limit on the axe.
    - Add Teleport limit to the axe - current value: 2 teleports.


Control:

    - REMOVE: Left click to throw the axe if the axe is being held.

    Lul time after throw: 0.4s.
    Time scale after teleport: 0.5.
